            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Joaquin Kaplan, I am 22 years-old and was born in Buenos Aires, Capital of Argentina, a country located in the very south of the world. Book-fan and writing aficionado, I am currently studying Political Science at Buenos Aires University. But... let's talk about what's really important: my favourite Netflix series is -of course- Orange is The New Black (love you, Suzanne!).</p>
            <h3>Why coding?</h3>
            <p>I'd better say: why not? If you, dear reader, are studying Social Sciences, you will understand what's going through my head when I write this. Understanding nowadays world without applying systemic thinking is just like pretending to understand Greek philosophy without reading Plato. Also, life is long (thanks Medicine) and there are plenty of reasons to exit the comfort zone and learn how to swim in different waters. If you still hesitate, JUST TRY! There will be no regrets. </p>
            <h3>My professional experience</h3>
            <p>I got my first job when I was 16, as office delivery. Nothing to do with coding or social sciences, but it trained me in rapid problem solving. After that, I worked as a Junior Analyst, and that was the moment I switched to Public sector, where I had the opportunity to learn about Legislative issues. Also, since 2020 I work as Assistant Professor at Buenos Aires University, and through 2021 I worked as English teacher at two schools. I always say (and I'm quite sure about it) that teaching is the big thing that englobes all the rest, as it requires dialogue, education, communication and constant learning habilities. Have those four know-hows, and success will be guaranteed everywhere!</p>

            <h3>Mi Buenos Aires querida☕</h3>
            <p>As I previously mentioned, I was born in Buenos Aires. Latin and European at the same time, it might be one of the most nostalgic cities in the world. Want Paris? Discover every corner of Recoleta. Want Modern? Just visit Puerto Madero. Want Bohemian? Why not visiting Palermo Soho! Want theatres, libraries, pizza and moanful (but friendly) people? Just Buenos Aires!</p>
            <h3>Madrid</h3>
            <p>"...y al pasar por las Cibeles, quiso sacarla a bailar..." How cute Ana Belén sounds when you write it down! About Madrid I could write a whole book. Although I've never officially lived there, I have a strong tie to such magic city -maybe because part of my family comes from Spain, or because its similarity to Buenos Aires, or its resilient identity-. Let's go have some Cañas y tapas!</p>
            <h3>Beersheba</h3>
            <p>Last but definitely not least comes Beersheba, 100 km away from vibrant Tel Aviv in Israel, the famous startup nation and home for every Jew in the world. Life changes, and so do I: 2022 will be a special year for me, as I will be learning Full Stack Development at ITC in order to be part of Israel's High-Tech Industry. I've been told that many Argentineans live there, so hopefully I will be heard when I say "Che!". </p>
